AI SERVICES SETUP - NODE ROLE APPROACH
=======================================

Question: "Will the EKS pods have access to call Textract and Bedrock using IAM?"

Answer: YES - Using the same pattern as your Kafka setup.

What Was Added:
---------------
modules/envs/ai-services.tf
  - Textract policy attached to EKS node role
  - Bedrock policy attached to EKS node role
  - Same pattern as your kafka.tf file

How It Works:
-------------
1. IAM policies attached to: module.eks.eks_managed_node_groups["main"].iam_role_name
2. All pods running on those nodes inherit the permissions
3. AWS SDK automatically discovers and uses node role credentials
4. No code changes or deployment changes needed

Permissions Granted:
--------------------
✅ Amazon Textract
   - All document analysis operations
   - OCR, forms, tables, expense, ID extraction
   - Sync and async operations

✅ Amazon Bedrock  
   - Invoke foundation models (Claude, Titan, Llama)
   - Streaming responses
   - Agents and Knowledge Bases

Comparison to IRSA (what we didn't do):
----------------------------------------
Node Role (what we did):
  ✅ Simple - matches your Kafka pattern
  ✅ No deployment changes needed
  ✅ Works immediately for all pods
  ⚠️  All pods get the permissions (broader access)

IRSA (alternative):
  ✅ Per-pod permissions (more secure)
  ✅ Least privilege
  ❌ Requires serviceAccountName in deployments
  ❌ More complex setup

For Your Use Case:
------------------
Node role is perfect because:
- You already use this pattern for Kafka
- Simpler to manage
- If you only have one backend app, security difference is minimal
- Won't break any existing deployments

To Deploy:
----------
terraform apply

Then developers can immediately use Textract/Bedrock in their code with AWS SDK.
No deployment changes needed.
